### Achintya Jha

I'm an incoming CS Major at Arizona State University. I am interested in Natural Language Processing, and I have been building a tool that you can check out [here](https://sentimate.org/), which can detect depression in text messages.
You can find more about me at my [website](https://achintyajha.com/).
