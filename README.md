I'm a high school senior at Ahlcon International School, studying Computer Science. I am interested in Natural Language Processing, and I have been building a tool that you can check out [here](https://sentimate.org/), which can identify depression through text messages.
You can find more about me at my [website](https://achintyajha.in/).
